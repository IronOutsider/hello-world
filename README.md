Hello World,

I'm an IT professional who has pretty much lived in the click next world of windows server and restrained IOS/NEXUS OS operating systems. I've dipped my toes into development with Powershell and I've followed game devolopment tutorials in the past to get a basic understanding of programming. Seeing how the IT world appears to be changing to API modeled and developement based (DevOp), I want to start making much needed improvements to my ability to program.
